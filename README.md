## About this project:
<p>Recently in college I was given the task of creating a program that can be used to search for jobs and post resumes, I had to implement the frontend using Bootstrap and backend using Laravel.</p>
<p>Thanks to this work, I learned how MVC works, mastered the work with the MySql database. The most difficult thing was to work with PHP functions, for example: str_replace, array_map, etc. I learned how to work with the "blade" templates from Laravel.</p>
